# Helix_Jump

In Helix Jump, a ball bounces up and down on a series of circular platforms held up by a pole. The objective of the game is to navigate a bouncing ball down a helix tower made up of different colored platforms. The player must guide the ball through the gaps of the platforms in order to reach the bottom of the tower. As the game progresses, the ball moves faster. The game ends when the ball hits an unsafe platform or falls off the edge.
